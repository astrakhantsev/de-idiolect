Below are usage excerpts from one community's documents, all containing the same term, shown masked as ⟦TERM⟧ (other local jargon is masked as ⟦X⟧).

Write a short, self-contained, operational definition of the concept ⟦TERM⟧ names AS USED in these excerpts: what kind of thing it is (a phenomenon, a procedure, a score, a rule…), its inputs and outputs where applicable, what it asserts, and when it applies.

COMMITMENTS CHECKLIST (extracted from the same excerpts — the definition must state every commitment, including the specific mechanism):
- Maintains a chronological, append-only log of dated entries recording specific changes made to the system/config (e.g., artifact-naming scheme, cap value changes).
- Entries record what was changed, and can be searched/scrolled back through to find a specific past change.
- Used diagnostically: consulted before investigating an issue to find the actual root-cause change among recent entries.
- Applies in a debugging/incident-investigation setting, triggered when unexpected behavior needs to be traced to its origin.
- Entries are tied to specific dates ("eleven days ago," "the same day"), enabling time-based lookup.
- Can reveal that an entry is unrelated to the issue being investigated, requiring the reader to distinguish relevant from irrelevant entries.

Constraints:
- Ordinary words and simple notation only.
- Do NOT use the masked terms or guess at them; do not use names of people, published methods, fields, systems, models, or communities.
- Base the definition ONLY on what the excerpts support; do not import outside assumptions.
- Do NOT add generalizing catch-all phrases (such as "or otherwise", "or any similar", "in any way", "or by other means") beyond what the excerpts support — state the specific mechanism, not its genus.
- 60–160 words. Output ONLY the definition text, nothing else.

EXCERPTS:

1. Good news is the ⟦TERM⟧ actually saved us here. Scrolled back through it and found an entry from eleven days ago noting we'd swapped the artifact-naming scheme in the scorer's config to include run id in the cache key.
2. Went to the ⟦TERM⟧ before touching anything and found the actual change two entries back: someone bumped the cap from four to two the same day, unrelated to what I was originally investigating. Cap of two is just too tight for a five-file task, not a bug in the enforcement code at all.
