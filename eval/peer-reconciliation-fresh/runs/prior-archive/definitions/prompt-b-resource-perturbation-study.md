Below are usage excerpts from one community's documents, all containing the same term, shown masked as ⟦TERM⟧ (other local jargon is masked as ⟦X⟧).

Write a short, self-contained, operational definition of the concept ⟦TERM⟧ names AS USED in these excerpts: what kind of thing it is (a phenomenon, a procedure, a score, a rule…), its inputs and outputs where applicable, what it asserts, and when it applies.

COMMITMENTS CHECKLIST (extracted from the same excerpts — the definition must state every commitment, including the specific mechanism):
- Mechanism: after the first successful retrieval, the intervention alters the agent's remaining token budget or tool-call quota, sometimes specifically lowering the tool-call quota partway through a task.
- Applies during multi-step agentic tasks involving chained browser/tool actions (e.g., web retrieval tasks), triggered once quotas are reduced mid-session.
- Measured/produced output: verification trace length (shorter vs. longer) and tool-initiation behavior (continuing to call tools until forced termination vs. stopping early).
- Scoring/reading: compares high-performing vs. lower-performing agents by whether they shorten verification traces as quotas fall, or keep initiating tools regardless.
- Constraint: does not fully eliminate inappropriate reuse of recently successful action sequences, even when redundant page openings decrease.
- Constraint: effect is on tool/budget-quota dynamics specifically, distinct from ordinary billing performance, which is largely unaffected.

Constraints:
- Ordinary words and simple notation only.
- Do NOT use the masked terms or guess at them; do not use names of people, published methods, fields, systems, models, or communities.
- Base the definition ONLY on what the excerpts support; do not import outside assumptions.
- Do NOT add generalizing catch-all phrases (such as "or otherwise", "or any similar", "in any way", "or by other means") beyond what the excerpts support — state the specific mechanism, not its genus.
- 60–160 words. Output ONLY the definition text, nothing else.

EXCERPTS:

1. Disagreements were concentrated in items involving chained browser actions rather than answer extraction. A ⟦TERM⟧ altered either the remaining token budget or tool-call quota after the first successful retrieval. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, high-performing agents shifted toward shorter verification traces when quotas fell, while lower-performing agents continued initiating tools until forced termination.
2. A ⟦TERM⟧ altered either the remaining token budget or tool-call quota after the first successful retrieval. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, high-performing agents shifted toward shorter verification traces when quotas fell, while lower-performing agents continued initiating tools until forced termination.
3. Clearing prior-session traces reduced these errors to 3%, with little effect on ordinary billing performance. A ⟦TERM⟧ lowered tool-call quota midway through the distractor versions.
4. A ⟦TERM⟧ lowered tool-call quota midway through the distractor versions. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, agents reduced redundant page openings but retained ⟦X⟧ at nearly the original rate. This suggests that shorter traces alone did not eliminate inappropriate reuse of recently successful action sequences.
