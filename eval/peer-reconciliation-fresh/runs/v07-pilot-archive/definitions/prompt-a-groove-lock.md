Below are usage excerpts from one community's documents, all containing the same term, shown masked as ⟦TERM⟧ (other local jargon is masked as ⟦X⟧).

Write THREE cumulative operational definitions of the concept ⟦TERM⟧ names AS USED in these excerpts, at three levels of specificity:

- "L0" — ONE sentence: what kind of thing it is (a phenomenon, a procedure, a score, a rule…) and its immediate purpose. Genus only, no mechanism.
- "L1" — L0's content PLUS the specific mechanism or process (what concretely happens). 2–4 sentences.
- "L2" — L1's content PLUS what is measured or produced and how it is scored or read, and when/where it applies. 60–160 words.

COMMITMENTS CHECKLIST (extracted from the same excerpts; L2 must state every commitment, L1 must state the mechanism commitments):
- Mechanism: the agent repeats an action/strategy that succeeded on a recent prior task, applying it unchanged to a new, different task without re-evaluating fit.
- Diagnostic test: clearing the session and re-presenting the same task in isolation causes the agent to choose correctly, confirming the error was carryover from the prior task rather than a capability gap.
- Trigger/setting: occurs when two tasks are handled close together (same session/batch) and the earlier task's successful approach superficially resembles the new one.
- Constraint violated: the carried-over strategy exceeds or mismatches a task-specific constraint (e.g., a resource "ration" or cost budget) that the new task actually requires respecting.
- Outcome measured: whether the reused strategy is well-suited (ration respected, correct choice) or ill-suited (ration tripped, task failed) to the current task, read from failure/session logs.
- Scope: the error is attributed to recency bias in strategy selection, not to a deficit in the agent's underlying capability to solve the new task correctly.

Constraints for ALL levels:
- Ordinary words and simple notation only; do NOT use the masked terms or guess at them; no names of people, published methods, fields, systems, models, or communities.
- Base everything ONLY on what the excerpts support; no generalizing catch-all phrases ("or otherwise", "or any similar", "in any way").
- Each level must be self-contained (do not reference the other levels).

Output ONLY JSON: {"L0": "...", "L1": "...", "L2": "..."}

EXCERPTS:

1. Blew away someone's WIP branch. Classic ⟦TERM⟧, and the tell was obvious in hindsight: clear the session, hand it the same ticket cold, and it picks the correct merge strategy first try. No capability gap, just recency doing the choosing instead of the task.
2. Going to rerun at five before we conclude anything. While debugging that I also caught a ⟦TERM⟧ case in the same log. The agent had just finished a task where grepping twice and then guessing worked fine, and it tried that same grep-twice-guess pattern on the navigation benchmark even though the ration made guessing expensive here — wrong move for this task, right move for the last one, cleared session and it adapted immediately.
3. Would've spent the whole day debugging the wrong thing without that log. While in there I also noticed a ⟦TERM⟧ case buried in the failure logs from the same batch. One of the agents had aced a similar-looking task earlier in the day by opening a config file, patching one line, and closing it — well within the ration — then tried the identical open-patch-close move on a task that actually needed cross-referencing two files simultaneously, tripped the ration, failed.
