Three DEFINITIONS of the same concept at increasing specificity:

DEFINITION L0 (genus only): A running written record kept to track the changes people make to a system over time, so that later problems can be traced back to earlier changes.

DEFINITION L1 (adds mechanism): A running written record kept to track the changes people make to a system over time, so that later problems can be traced back to earlier changes. New notes are added to the end as changes happen, each one dated and describing what was altered. When something behaves unexpectedly, a person reads backward through the notes to find which earlier change is the real cause before altering anything further.

DEFINITION L2 (adds measurement and conditions): A chronological, add-to-the-end written record kept to track the changes people make to a system, so that later problems can be traced to earlier changes. Each dated entry records what was changed and includes the concrete detail of the change itself (for example, a limit lowered from four to two, or a naming scheme switched to fold a run identifier into a cached key). Because entries are tied to specific dates and times, they can be ordered and pointed to relative to one another ("eleven days ago," "two entries back"). When investigating unexpected behavior, a person scrolls or pages backward through the entries to locate the actual earlier change responsible, which lets them tell a genuine defect apart from a deliberate prior adjustment before making any further changes.

Below are numbered excerpts from a community's documents in which one term — masked as ⟦TERM⟧ — is used (other local jargon masked ⟦X⟧).

For EACH excerpt, and for EACH definition level INDEPENDENTLY, decide: is the referent of ⟦TERM⟧, as used in THIS excerpt, an instance of the concept described by THAT definition?

- "instantiates" — the usage is consistent with and exemplifies that definition.
- "contradicts" — the usage is incompatible with that definition (the referent has a property that definition excludes, or lacks one it requires).
- "insufficient" — this excerpt alone does not contain enough to decide for that definition.

A usage can instantiate L0 while contradicting L2 — judge each level on its own content. Judge each excerpt on its own text only. For L1 and L2, any decided verdict (instantiates or contradicts) requires a verbatim supporting quote from the excerpt; L0 needs no quote.

Output ONLY a JSON array, one object per excerpt:
[{"excerpt": 1, "L0": "instantiates|contradicts|insufficient", "L1": {"verdict": "...", "quote": "verbatim or empty for insufficient"}, "L2": {"verdict": "...", "quote": "..."}}, ...]

EXCERPTS:

1. Agents completed 600 repository-repair tasks with five independent attempts per task and fresh tool sandboxes. The ⟦TERM⟧ was calculated only from successful attempts after traces were normalized for incidental file paths. The ⟦TERM⟧ increased from 1.3 to 2.7 between the baseline and search-augmented systems, even when their pass rates differed by less than one point.
2. The ⟦TERM⟧ was calculated only from successful attempts after traces were normalized for incidental file paths. The ⟦TERM⟧ increased from 1.3 to 2.7 between the baseline and search-augmented systems, even when their pass rates differed by less than one point.
3. Prompt templates included two worked examples with unusual connective phrases. The ⟦X⟧ found that agents with the highest ⟦TERM⟧ had fewer inappropriate copied phrases than agents relying on repeated repair traces.
4. Human review rejected 11% of generated tasks for ambiguous state transitions, leaving 1,740 tasks. Successful runs were clustered by structural tool-use pattern before computing the ⟦TERM⟧. The ⟦TERM⟧ was higher on tasks from the most diverse generator, although completion rates were nearly unchanged.
5. Successful runs were clustered by structural tool-use pattern before computing the ⟦TERM⟧. The ⟦TERM⟧ was higher on tasks from the most diverse generator, although completion rates were nearly unchanged. This pattern held after normalizing for the number of available tools and the length of task instructions.
6. Under that round, the ⟦TERM⟧ remained elevated for agents that alternated inspection and verification rather than following a fixed retrieval-first sequence. The result should be interpreted cautiously because generator diversity also changed the distribution of error messages.
