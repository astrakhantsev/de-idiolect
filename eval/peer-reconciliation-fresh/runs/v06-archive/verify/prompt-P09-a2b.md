DEFINITION of a concept:

A chronologically ordered, continuously appended log in which each entry records a single specific change made to the scoring setup's configuration or parameters — for example the artifact-naming scheme in the scorer's config, a cap value, a tool-call timeout, a retry-count, or a prompt-template edit — together with when it was made. When a score drops or a metric dips, you scroll back through it or search it to find the relevant prior entry, then compare the timing of the change against the timing of the anomaly to identify the true cause and rule out a plausible but wrong one (for instance, attributing a four-point drop to a timeout bump rather than a model update). It is kept open in a side window for ongoing monitoring across a week, and by cross-checking anomaly timing against logged changes it catches false alarms before a cause is misattributed or escalated.

Below are numbered excerpts from a community's documents in which one term — masked as ⟦TERM⟧ — is used.

For EACH excerpt independently, decide: is the referent of ⟦TERM⟧, as used in THIS excerpt, an instance of the concept described by DEFINITION?

- "instantiates" — the usage is consistent with the definition and exemplifies it. Requires a verbatim supporting quote from the excerpt.
- "contradicts" — the usage is incompatible with the definition (the referent has a property the definition excludes, or lacks one it requires). Requires a verbatim quote of the incompatible fragment.
- "insufficient" — this excerpt alone does not contain enough to decide.

Judge each excerpt on its own text only. Do not let other excerpts or the term's surface influence you.

Output ONLY a JSON array, one object per excerpt:
[{"excerpt": 1, "verdict": "instantiates|contradicts|insufficient", "quote": "verbatim quote (empty string only for insufficient)"}, ...]

EXCERPTS:

1. Agents completed 600 repository-repair tasks with five independent attempts per task and fresh tool sandboxes. The ⟦TERM⟧ was calculated only from successful attempts after traces were normalized for incidental file paths. The ⟦TERM⟧ increased from 1.3 to 2.7 between the baseline and search-augmented systems, even when their pass rates differed by less than one point.
2. The ⟦TERM⟧ was calculated only from successful attempts after traces were normalized for incidental file paths. The ⟦TERM⟧ increased from 1.3 to 2.7 between the baseline and search-augmented systems, even when their pass rates differed by less than one point.
3. Prompt templates included two worked examples with unusual connective phrases. The ⟦X⟧ found that agents with the highest ⟦TERM⟧ had fewer inappropriate copied phrases than agents relying on repeated repair traces.
4. Human review rejected 11% of generated tasks for ambiguous state transitions, leaving 1,740 tasks. Successful runs were clustered by structural tool-use pattern before computing the ⟦TERM⟧. The ⟦TERM⟧ was higher on tasks from the most diverse generator, although completion rates were nearly unchanged.
5. Successful runs were clustered by structural tool-use pattern before computing the ⟦TERM⟧. The ⟦TERM⟧ was higher on tasks from the most diverse generator, although completion rates were nearly unchanged. This pattern held after normalizing for the number of available tools and the length of task instructions.
6. Under that round, the ⟦TERM⟧ remained elevated for agents that alternated inspection and verification rather than following a fixed retrieval-first sequence. The result should be interpreted cautiously because generator diversity also changed the distribution of error messages.
