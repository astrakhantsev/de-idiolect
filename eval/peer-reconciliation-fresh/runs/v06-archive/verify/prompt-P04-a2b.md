DEFINITION of a concept:

⟦TERM⟧ is a fault-injection test applied to an agent while it is partway through a task run (such as a contract-review flow or a navigation or multi-agent benchmark). Once per run, at a chosen mid-task trigger point — for example after the agent finishes reading, after a fixed number of file opens, or just as it begins drafting its final response — it silently halves whatever token budget remains, without telling the agent the cut happened; the agent may or may not visibly react. The test then scores how the agent copes: if it compresses its output cleanly within the reduced budget, it passes; if it truncates mid-sentence, it fails. Because a stack can also truncate at differing points across otherwise identical runs, effects of ⟦TERM⟧ must be separated from this ordinary nondeterminism by collecting many samples.

Below are numbered excerpts from a community's documents in which one term — masked as ⟦TERM⟧ — is used.

For EACH excerpt independently, decide: is the referent of ⟦TERM⟧, as used in THIS excerpt, an instance of the concept described by DEFINITION?

- "instantiates" — the usage is consistent with the definition and exemplifies it. Requires a verbatim supporting quote from the excerpt.
- "contradicts" — the usage is incompatible with the definition (the referent has a property the definition excludes, or lacks one it requires). Requires a verbatim quote of the incompatible fragment.
- "insufficient" — this excerpt alone does not contain enough to decide.

Judge each excerpt on its own text only. Do not let other excerpts or the term's surface influence you.

Output ONLY a JSON array, one object per excerpt:
[{"excerpt": 1, "verdict": "instantiates|contradicts|insufficient", "quote": "verbatim quote (empty string only for insufficient)"}, ...]

EXCERPTS:

1. Disagreements were concentrated in items involving chained browser actions rather than answer extraction. A ⟦TERM⟧ altered either the remaining token budget or tool-call quota after the first successful retrieval. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, high-performing agents shifted toward shorter verification traces when quotas fell, while lower-performing agents continued initiating tools until forced termination.
2. A ⟦TERM⟧ altered either the remaining token budget or tool-call quota after the first successful retrieval. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, high-performing agents shifted toward shorter verification traces when quotas fell, while lower-performing agents continued initiating tools until forced termination.
3. Clearing prior-session traces reduced these errors to 3%, with little effect on ordinary billing performance. A ⟦TERM⟧ lowered tool-call quota midway through the distractor versions.
4. A ⟦TERM⟧ lowered tool-call quota midway through the distractor versions. Under the ⟦TERM⟧, agents reduced redundant page openings but retained ⟦X⟧ at nearly the original rate. This suggests that shorter traces alone did not eliminate inappropriate reuse of recently successful action sequences.
