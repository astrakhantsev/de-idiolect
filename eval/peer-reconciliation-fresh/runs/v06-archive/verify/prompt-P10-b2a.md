DEFINITION of a concept:

A per-task difficulty or threshold rating, assigned independently by two annotators before deployment or inspection of model results. It states the level at which a task should be expected to succeed and is a property of the task, not of a model or run. Annotators may revise it when they find hidden dependencies such as unavailable credentials; 4.7% of tasks were revised this way. Agent results are assessed against the rating: failures on tasks below an agent’s rating are flagged for audit rather than counted as ordinary misses. Analyses include only tasks with stable, agreed ratings after adjudication and exclude unresolved disagreements. Disagreement is concentrated in chained, multi-step actions rather than simple answer extraction. Ratings do not establish one monotonic capability scale: memorized procedures can pass higher-rated tasks while unfamiliar tool states defeat lower-rated ones.

Below are numbered excerpts from a community's documents in which one term — masked as ⟦TERM⟧ — is used.

For EACH excerpt independently, decide: is the referent of ⟦TERM⟧, as used in THIS excerpt, an instance of the concept described by DEFINITION?

- "instantiates" — the usage is consistent with the definition and exemplifies it. Requires a verbatim supporting quote from the excerpt.
- "contradicts" — the usage is incompatible with the definition (the referent has a property the definition excludes, or lacks one it requires). Requires a verbatim quote of the incompatible fragment.
- "insufficient" — this excerpt alone does not contain enough to decide.

Judge each excerpt on its own text only. Do not let other excerpts or the term's surface influence you.

Output ONLY a JSON array, one object per excerpt:
[{"excerpt": 1, "verdict": "instantiates|contradicts|insufficient", "quote": "verbatim quote (empty string only for insufficient)"}, ...]

EXCERPTS:

1. Set a ⟦TERM⟧ of three on the new codebase-navigation benchmark, figuring it'd force the agent to actually hold file contents in working memory instead of treating disk as free scratch space. First real run, agent fails outright — opened auth.py four times chasing down a decorator it kept forgetting the signature of.
2. Agent didn't visibly react at all, just kept reading files at the same pace until it got cut off mid-trace. So under the ⟦TERM⟧ it ignores rereads that would help it finish, but under ⟦X⟧ it also doesn't compress. Not a great week for this benchmark.
3. Spent Monday convinced our ⟦TERM⟧ enforcement had silently broken, because three agents that used to pass the file-navigation suite started failing en masse.
4. Capped the day off by setting a ⟦TERM⟧ on the onboarding suite for the first time, since half of what's inflating the pass-everything bucket in that census looks like agents brute-forcing through repeated file opens instead of actually reasoning. Ration of three, rerunning tomorrow, expecting the pass-everything number to finally move.
